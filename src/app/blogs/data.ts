      <ol>
        <li>Upload your PDF file to the compression tool.</li>
        <li>Select the level of compression you need.</li>
        <li>Wait a few seconds for our tool to work its magic.</li>
        <li>Download your newly slimmed-down PDF!</li>
      </ol>

        content: `
      <p>The debate between PDF and Word has been ongoing for decades. Both formats have their strengths, and knowing when to use each is key to being productive in any professional or academic setting.</p>

      <h3>When to Use Word</h3>
      <p>Microsoft Word (.docx) is the gold standard for creating and editing content. If you're still in the process of writing, collaborating with others, or need to make frequent changes, Word is the way to go. Its flexibility is unmatched for drafting documents.</p>

      <h3>When to Use PDF</h3>
      <p>Portable Document Format (PDF) is designed for sharing. Once your document is finished, converting it to PDF ensures that it will look exactly the same on every device, from a smartphone to a high-end desktop. It's the best choice for resumes, final reports, and official contracts.</p>

      <h3>The Hybrid Approach</h3>
      <p>Most people find that they need both. You might draft a contract in Word, but then convert it to PDF before sending it to a client for their signature. At FileMint, we offer tools to easily convert between these two formats whenever the need arises.</p>

      <p>Gone are the days when you needed expensive desktop software just to fix a typo in a PDF. Online editing tools have revolutionized how we interact with these documents. Here's how you can make quick edits right from your web browser.</p>

      <h3>No Installation Required</h3>
      <p>One of the biggest benefits of online PDF editors is that you don't have to download or install anything. Just head to the website, upload your file, and you're ready to start editing immediately.</p>

      <h3>Essential Editing Features</h3>
      <p>Modern online editors allow you to add text, insert images, and even draw on your PDF. You can also use them to hide sensitive information through redaction or to add important notes and comments for your team.</p>

      <h3>Security Matters</h3>
      <p>When editing documents online, always ensure you're using a secure platform. Look for tools that use encryption and promise to delete your files from their servers after a certain period of time. Your privacy should always be a top priority.</p>

      <p>Sometimes a PDF isn't the final destination. You might need to turn that document into a Word file so you can edit the text, or a JPG image so you can easily post it on social media. Understanding the conversion process is essential.</p>

      <h3>PDF to Word</h3>
      <p>Converting a PDF back to Word can be tricky if the original document was scanned or has a complex layout. However, high-quality conversion tools can preserve most of your formatting, giving you a great starting point for further editing.</p>

      <h3>PDF to JPG</h3>
      <p>If you're looking to share a specific page of a PDF as an image, converting it to JPG is the perfect solution. It's much easier to include in a presentation or a website than a full PDF document.</p>

      <p>Whatever your conversion needs, FileMint has you covered with fast, accurate, and secure tools that make the process a breeze.</p>

        image: p6,
        content: `
      <p>Optical Character Recognition, or OCR, sounds like something out of a science fiction novel, but it's actually one of the most useful features of modern PDF tools. Let's break down how it works and why you need it.</p>

      <h3>The Problem with Scanned PDFs</h3>
      <p>When you scan a physical document, your computer sees it as just a big image. You can't search for specific words, and you certainly can't copy and paste the text. This is a major limitation for digital archiving.</p>

      <h3>Enter OCR</h3>
      <p>OCR software "looks" at the images of letters and numbers in your document and converts them into actual text characters that a computer can understand. Once OCR has been performed, your document becomes fully searchable and editable.</p>

      <h3>Why It's a Game-Changer</h3>
      <p>For businesses looking to digitize their old records, OCR is indispensable. It allows you to quickly find information in thousands of pages of old documents, making your data more accessible and useful than ever before.</p>

        content: `
      <p>Sometimes you receive a PDF where the pages are in the wrong order, or even worse, some are sideways or upside down. Don't worry—fixing these issues is simpler than you might think.</p>

      <h3>Reordering Made Simple</h3>
      <p>With a good PDF organizer, you can see all your pages as small thumbnails. Simply click and drag them into the correct order. It's as easy as organizing photos on your phone.</p>

      <h3>Fixing Orientation</h3>
      <p>If you have a page that was scanned in landscape mode but should be portrait, you can rotate it with a single click. You can rotate individual pages or the entire document at once, depending on your needs.</p>

      <p>Keeping your documents well-organized and properly oriented is professional and makes them much easier for others to read. With FileMint, you can perfect your PDF layout in seconds.</p>

      <p>Interactive forms are the best way to collect data from clients or employees. Instead of making them print, sign, and scan a document, you can let them fill it out directly on their computer.</p>

      <h3>Adding Form Fields</h3>
      <p>A good form creator allows you to add various types of fields, including text boxes for names and addresses, checkboxes for list items, and even drop-down menus for selecting from a list of options.</p>

      <h3>The User Experience</h3>
      <p>Fillable forms are much more convenient for the user. They look cleaner, prevent handwriting errors, and can be completed much faster than traditional paper forms.</p>

      <h3>Getting Started</h3>
      <p>Creating your own fillable PDF is easy with the right online tools. Just upload your base document and start dragging form elements wherever you need them. It's a simple change that can make your business much more efficient.</p>

      <p>When you're dealing with sensitive documents, security is everything. If you're using an online PDF editor, it's natural to wonder if your data is safe. Let's look at what makes a platform secure.</p>

      <h3>Encryption is Key</h3>
      <p>Any reputable online tool should use SSL/TLS encryption for all file transfers. This ensures that nobody can intercept your document as it's traveling between your computer and the server.</p>

      <h3>Data Deletion Policies</h3>
      <p>Always check a tool's privacy policy to see how long they keep your files. The most secure options automatically delete your documents from their servers after a few hours, ensuring that your data doesn't stick around long-term.</p>

      <h3>Your Responsibility</h3>
      <p>While tools like FileMint do everything possible to keep you safe, it's also important to be smart. Avoid using public Wi-Fi when editing very sensitive documents and always keep your own software up to date.</p>

      <p>Even though editing PDFs is easier than ever, there are still some common pitfalls that can lead to lost work or professional embarrassment. Avoid these five mistakes to ensure your documents are always perfect.</p>

      <h3>1. Forgetting to Save a Backup</h3>
      <p>Always keep the original version of your PDF until you're absolutely sure your edits are correct. It's much easier to start over than to try and undo complex changes.</p>

      <h3>2. Neglecting Mobile Optimization</h3>
      <p>Most people will read your PDF on a smartphone. Make sure your text is large enough to read on a small screen and avoid overly complex layouts that might not render properly on mobile devices.</p>

      <h3>3. Over-Compressing Images</h3>
      <p>While smaller file sizes are great, compressing your document too much can make your images look pixelated and unprofessional. Always aim for a balance between size and quality.</p>

      <h3>4. Leaving Sensitive Metadata</h3>
      <p>PDFs often contain hidden information about who created the document and what changes were made. Be sure to use a tool that can strip this metadata if you're sharing a sensitive file.</p>

      <h3>5. Not Proofreading One Last Time</h3>
      <p>It's a simple tip, but one that many people forget. Before you hit that download button, take one more look at your edits to make sure everything is exactly where it should be.</p>

      <p>A PDF looks exactly the same whether it's opened on a Mac, a PC, or a Linux machine. For a business, this consistency is vital for maintaining a professional image and ensuring that all employees see the same information.</p>

      <h3>Professional Security Features</h3>
      <p>PDFs offer robust security options, including password protection and document permissions. This allows businesses to control exactly who can view, print, or edit their most sensitive files.</p>

      <h3>Compact and Organized</h3>
      <p>Despite their high quality, PDFs can be incredibly compact. They also support advanced features like bookmarks and internal links, making them perfect for long manuals and complex research papers.</p>
